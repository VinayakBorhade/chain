This is a basic framework for a blockchain, and it has some components missing.
Your assignment is to extend the program to include the following features:
1. Add a wallet generation script which allows users to create and use wallets.
2. Modify the transactions such that each transaction has a wallet address associated with it.
3. Create an API where the user can query the blockchain to find out his current wallet balance.
You are required to submit Python code with proper comments.
